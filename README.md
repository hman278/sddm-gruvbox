## Usage
1. Download your preferred theme variant from the [releases page](https://github.com/hman278/sddm-gruvbox/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded archive into the following directory:  
   `/usr/share/sddm/themes/`
3. Open the SDDM configuration file located at `/etc/sddm.conf`. Set the theme by adding or modifying the following lines:

   ```
   [Theme]
   Current=sddm-gruvbox
   ```



   > If `/etc/sddm.conf` doesnâ€™t exist, you can create it manually. Just ensure it has the `.conf` extension and includes the lines above.
